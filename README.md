###About

FortniteStarred It's a on-going project meant to facilitate to users informantion related to fortnite in-game items, weapons & more. All the data is provided by [<forniteapi.com>](https://fortniteapi.com).

Currently the project have three main sections:

###Why to create FortniteStarred?
I was looking for a clean and simple way to look up fornite items without too much hassle. Moreover, I wanted to test a new styling library called react-jss (especifically it's latest alpha version) which btw it's very powerfull with it's new react hook.

#####Relevant tech stack used in this project
